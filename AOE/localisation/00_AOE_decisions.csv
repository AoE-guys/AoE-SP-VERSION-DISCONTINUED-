The Theresiana was meant to introduce uniform criminal law and procedure throughout the Habsburg Crown Lands and remained in effect until the reforms of Emperor Joseph II in 1787. To that end, it included a series of appendices, which showed how judicial torture should properly be applied. (The law did not apply in Hungary);;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
